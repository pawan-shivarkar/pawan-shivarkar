- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pawan-shivarkar
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Security Research (Vulnerability, Malware, Fuzzing, Low-Level)...
-   I'm a Staff System Software Security Engineer at NVIDIA, focusing on GPU system security. Previously, I was  Security Research Manager at Qualys, driving research on OSS, Linux, and system software under the Threat Research Unit. Iâ€™ve also held roles at Microsoft (MSRC), FireEye (FLARE-OTF), and Symantec (STAR Team), specializing in vulnerability and malware research.
